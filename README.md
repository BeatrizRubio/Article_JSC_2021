# Accurate computations with collocation and Wronskian matrices of Jacobi polynomials
In this repository, the bidiagonal decompositions (BDA) of the collocation and  Wronskian matrices of Jacobi polynomials are provided.

1. In [Collocation_matrix_Jacobi](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/Article_JSC_2021/tree/main/Collocation_matrix_Jacobi) the bidiagonal decomposition of the collocation matrix of Jacobi basis is provided. Experiment results obtained with the functions available in http://math.mit.edu/~plamen/software/TNTool.html are presented. We also include the relative errors obtained in Mathematica. 
2. In [Wronskian_matrix_Jacobi](https://github.com/BeatrizRubio/Article_JSC_2021/tree/main/Wronskian_matrix_Jacobi) the bidiagonal decomposition of the Wronskian matrix of Jacobi basis is provided. Experiment results obtained with the functions available in http://math.mit.edu/~plamen/software/TNTool.html are presented. We also include the relative errors obtained in Mathematica. 

The implementation uses Matlab 2020b and Wolfram Mathematica.
